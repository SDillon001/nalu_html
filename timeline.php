Pomar looked at the caballito for a moment. The Hawaiians, he asked with a little rhetorical tilt of the head, have been surfing for how long? One thousand years? Fifteen hundred? He nodded toward the caballito. Three thousand years, he said. That’s how long they’ve been riding waves in Huanchaco. Three thousand years—maybe longer.”</p>

                              <p>Only on the main islands of what is called East Polynesia (Hawaii, the Marquesas, Tahiti, the Cook Islands, and New Zealand) was surfing practiced by adults as well as children. Of this group, just the Tahitians and Hawaiians used full-length boards and rode while standing. And of these two, only the Hawaiians, probably beginning around a.d. 1200, developed the sport into a communal obsession. This original surf-lust, as much as the islands’ accrued developments in board design and riding technique, is what marks Hawaii as surfing’s birthplace.</p>

                              <p>“All thought of work is at an end,” a nineteenth-century Hawaiian scholar wrote, describing his ancestors’ wave-riding fervency in terms recognizable to any hardcore twenty-first-century surfer. “The wife may go hungry, [and] the children . . . but the head of the house does not care. All day there is nothing but surfing.”</p>

                            <p>Not much is known about Gurrey's early life. He was born (1874) in Kansas, and took an engineering degree from the University of California, Berkeley, before moving with his family to Hawaii, probably around 1899. Shortly after he married Caroline Haskins, a nationally known portrait photographer, and the two operated a series of galleries in Honolulu for the next two decades.</p>

                            <p>Gurrey took to surfing shortly after arriving in Honolulu, and became a member of the Hui Nalu surf club, where he shared waves with Duke Kahanmoku, and began to photograph his fellow surfers. Most of Gurrey's shots are taken from the side; taken from a pier, or from a canoe riding alonside his subjects. His work first appeared in surfing promoter Alexander Hume Ford's publication Mid-Pacific Magazine, in 1911. A few years later Gurrey collected the best of his photographs and included them in The Surf Riders of Hawaii. The booklet is roughly 7" x 7", contains eight board-mounted gelatin-silver images, and a short block of Gurrey-penned text on surfing.</p>

                            <p>In 1929, Tom Blake built the first waterproof camera housing used exclusively for surf photography. Most previous surfing photos had been taken from canoes or boats but Blake produced images from the unique perspective of a surfboard. Many of his early images were published internationally. He used his own photographs to illustrate his first book. National Geographic magazine was so taken by his work they featured a number of his images in an article published in 1935.</p>

                            <p>"I bought a 4x5 graflex camera from Duke Kahanamoku in 1929," as Blake recalls the event. "I built a big wooden box about two feet high around it and placed the controls on the outside. The idea was to shoot surfing photos from my board. It was crude and clumsy. The lens would fog up so I placed a wiper on the inside of the box's lens. I managed to get some pretty good shots and everybody wanted their photo taken. It really took off when I sent the L.A.Times some images. In January of 1931, they ran a full page spread in their Sunday photogravure section. It was called "Riders Of The Sunset Seas." This image got Doc Ball and Dr. Don James so excited they both eventually became well known surf photographers."</p>

                            <p>Surf club membership wasn’t mandatory for California surfers, but by the late 1930s you could have driven a Packard Super 8 from San Diego to Santa Cruz and had a hard time loading it up with nonaffiliated surfers. Unlike the surf-based organizations in Hawaii and Australia, these new clubs were focused on surfing, and a bit of paddling, and nothing else. California’s best-known and best-organized group was the Palos Verdes Surf Club, founded in 1935 by a surfing dentist named John “Doc” Ball. Headquartered south of Los Angeles in Gardena, where Ball had a dental practice, the PVSC took its name from the nearby Palos Verdes Peninsula, home to a quietly wealthy Mediterranean-themed bedroom community, as well as the Cove, a beautiful cliff-lined bay sometimes referred to as “Little Waikiki.” Just under thirty surfers took the club oath and became PVSC members during the 1930s. A dozen other similar clubs were formed up and down the coast, every one filled with young gung-ho middle-class surfers, roughly half of them college students.</p>

                            <p>The surf club movement said a lot about how the sport was developing in America. Surfers now had the numbers and confidence to join together in organizations having little or nothing to do with extraneous things like lifeguarding or canoeing. Wave-riding was enough. At the same time, clubs like the PVSC helped validate an experience that was still new and a little strange; all of the established rituals of club life allowed the sport to be talked about and presented in terms familiar to everyone, surfers and nonsurfers alike.</p>

                            <blockquote>Six months after one of Palos Verdes Surf Club's top riders dropped out of college to spend more time on the beach, he was called to clubhouse floor and told to return to class or face expulsion. There was the occasional clubhouse booze-up, but PVSC members mostly all walked the line.</blockquote>

                            <p>With clubs on the rise, surfing took another inevitable step toward organized competition, which meant rules and standings, winners and losers, trophies and championships—the staff of life to sportsmen of all kind. Also, there was a flattery inherent in the rise of club-sponsored events, contests, and newsletters, in that they all promised to put the surfer at the center of the action. In a social and cultural sense, this was essential to the development of the sport. But it didn’t reflect the surfer’s experience in the water, which constantly veered into the wild, to places that had nothing to do with any regulated or organized form of sport.</p>

                            <p>A rudimentary form of surfboard retailing began in 1949, when longtime Southern California surfer and boardmaker Dale Velzy opened a tiny factory-storefront in Manhattan Beach. His operation took off five years later, when he opened a bigger shop in Venice Beach, with fellow shaper Hap Jacobs, and they introduced the wildly popular Velzy-Jacobs “pig” model.</p>

                            <p>Velzy soon had competition from a 21-year-old boardmaker from Laguna Beach named Hobie Alter, who was as sober and organized as Velzy was flamboyant and impulsive. Alter built 80 boards during his first three years as a shaper—nothing close to Velzy’s numbers, but more by far than any other Orange County boardmaker. Not only were the boards well-crafted—even at this early stage, before Alter had come up with a decal, before he even signed his work—they were reasonably priced ($45) and always delivered on time, unlike the typical Velzy-Jacobs job.</p>

                            <p>In 1954 Alter bought a weedy vacant lot in an unincorporated Dana Point/Pacific Coast Highway “retail district” that featured just two other stores. Alter then built an L-shaped building, with a small but bright glass-fronted retail space and a windowless cement-walled factory attached to the back. Fifteen hundred Hobie boards [were] sold altogether between 1954 and early 1958, at a time when the total number of surfers in California wasn’t much above five thousand.</p>

                            <p>Velzy swooped down from Los Angeles in 1955 to open a new outlet in San Clemente, on Pacific Coast Highway, just five miles south of Hobie’s shop, for the express purpose of siphoning off potential customers driving up from San Diego. And thus began the start of the first great American boardmaker’s rivalry. Customers lined up behind one man or the other, Hobie or Velzy, giving their allegiance not just to a brand but a form of surfing leadership.</p>
