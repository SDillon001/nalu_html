        <p>A rudimentary form of surfboard retailing began in 1949, when longtime Southern California surfer and boardmaker Dale Velzy opened a tiny factory-storefront in Manhattan Beach. In 1954, after two or three quiet surveillance trips to Velzy’s shop, and with a $1,000 gift from his father, Hobie Alter opened a shop in Dana Point/Pacific Coast Highway “retail district” and a sufboard building rivalry was born.</p>

        <p>In the early 1950s, a handful of Honolulu surfers decided to tackle big-wave riding as a kind of Manhattan Project. John Kelly and the other original hot curlers had first ridden Makaha in 1937, and over the next fifteen years ambitious Hawaiians had continued making occasional day-trip visits to test themselves in incrementally bigger waves.</p>

And it wasn’t a gradual change. It was like someone threw a switch, and all of a sudden guys didn’t give a shit about society, or what other people thought of them.”</p>

        <p>No sport in the world, in fact, was shot from so many angles. Surfers were photographed from underwater, from helicopters, from the back of a Jet Ski running full-throttle just ahead of the wave, and from a wide-angle board-mounted camera operated from the beach by remote control.</p>

                        <p>Only on the main islands of what is called East Polynesia (Hawaii, the Marquesas, Tahiti, the Cook Islands, and New Zealand) was surfing practiced by adults as well as children. Of this group, just the Tahitians and Hawaiians used full-length boards and rode while standing. And of these two, only the Hawaiians, probably beginning around a.d. 1200, developed the sport into a communal obsession. This original surf-lust, as much as the islands’ accrued developments in board design and riding technique, is what marks Hawaii as surfing’s birthplace.</p>

                        <p>“All thought of work is at an end,” a nineteenth-century Hawaiian scholar wrote, describing his ancestors’ wave-riding fervency in terms recognizable to any hardcore twenty-first-century surfer. “The wife may go hungry, [and] the children . . . but the head of the house does not care. All day there is nothing but surfing.”</p>

                        <p>Not much is known about Gurrey's early life. He was born (1874) in Kansas, and took an engineering degree from the University of California, Berkeley, before moving with his family to Hawaii, probably around 1899. Shortly after he married Caroline Haskins, a nationally known portrait photographer, and the two operated a series of galleries in Honolulu for the next two decades.</p>

                        <p>Gurrey took to surfing shortly after arriving in Honolulu, and became a member of the Hui Nalu surf club, where he shared waves with Duke Kahanmoku, and began to photograph his fellow surfers. Most of Gurrey's shots are taken from the side; taken from a pier, or from a canoe riding alonside his subjects. His work first appeared in surfing promoter Alexander Hume Ford's publication Mid-Pacific Magazine, in 1911. A few years later Gurrey collected the best of his photographs and included them in The Surf Riders of Hawaii. The booklet is roughly 7" x 7", contains eight board-mounted gelatin-silver images, and a short block of Gurrey-penned text on surfing.</p>

                        <p>In 1929, Tom Blake built the first waterproof camera housing used exclusively for surf photography. Most previous surfing photos had been taken from canoes or boats but Blake produced images from the unique perspective of a surfboard. Many of his early images were published internationally. He used his own photographs to illustrate his first book. National Geographic magazine was so taken by his work they featured a number of his images in an article published in 1935.</p>

                        <p>"I bought a 4x5 graflex camera from Duke Kahanamoku in 1929," as Blake recalls the event. "I built a big wooden box about two feet high around it and placed the controls on the outside. The idea was to shoot surfing photos from my board. It was crude and clumsy. The lens would fog up so I placed a wiper on the inside of the box's lens. I managed to get some pretty good shots and everybody wanted their photo taken. It really took off when I sent the L.A.Times some images. In January of 1931, they ran a full page spread in their Sunday photogravure section. It was called "Riders Of The Sunset Seas." This image got Doc Ball and Dr. Don James so excited they both eventually became well known surf photographers."</p>

                        <p>Surf club membership wasn’t mandatory for California surfers, but by the late 1930s you could have driven a Packard Super 8 from San Diego to Santa Cruz and had a hard time loading it up with nonaffiliated surfers. California’s best-known and best-organized group was the Palos Verdes Surf Club, founded in 1935 by a surfing dentist named John “Doc” Ball. Just under thirty surfers took the club oath and became PVSC members during the 1930s. A dozen other similar clubs were formed up and down the coast, every one filled with young gung-ho middle-class surfers, roughly half of them college students.</p>

                        <p>With clubs on the rise, surfing took another inevitable step toward organized competition, which meant rules and standings, winners and losers, trophies and championships—the staff of life to sportsmen of all kind.</p>

                        <blockquote class="equip-merrick">Also, there was a flattery inherent in the rise of club-sponsored events, contests, and newsletters, in that they all promised to put the surfer at the center of the action. In a social and cultural sense, this was essential to the development of the sport. But it didn’t reflect the surfer’s experience in the water, which constantly veered into the wild, to places that had nothing to do with any regulated or organized form of sport.</blockquote>

                        <p>Why did Southern California give birth to a national surfing craze? One simple, attractive, ahistorical, quasi-magical explanation is that modern surfing conjured itself into existence from the perfect air that hung over the perfect beach next to the perfect waves at Malibu. Surfing actually made Malibu, but never mind. From the late 1940s to the early 1960s, it often seemed to be the other way around.</p>

                        <p>Just like at Waikiki and San Onofre, Malibu changed the sport on the land as well as in the water. This sandy hook of beachfront would in fact be surf culture’s last and greatest site-specific incubator. Loose-fitting clothes, bouncy slang, pride in the sport’s detachment from other sports (and the insolence that comes with that pride), a default wariness toward other surfers, flashing public nudity and other forms of mild social rebellion—a good part of the surfer stylebook was drafted at Malibu, beginning in 1945.</p>

                        <blockquote class="equip-merrick">No surf break, then or now, has ever presented itself as well as Malibu. Each wave rolled forth as if it had traveled halfway across the Pacific for the express purpose of gliding into this quarter-mile bit of shoreline.</blockquote>

                        <p>In a complete turnaround from the 1930s, surfers no longer showed any interest in organizing the sport through clubs or competitions. At this point, surfing had been part of Southern California’s recreational landscape for forty years. It had its own history, and was beginning to take on the heft of permanence, which likely helped the Malibu surfers make a bigger commitment to the sport. Lounging on the beach was a harder act to justify during the postwar prosperity boom than it had been during the Depression. In 1937, it was possible to ride waves for hours a day because there wasn’t much else to do. In 1947, serious water time was paid for with reduced paychecks and a much-shortened list of job choices. For a lot of surfers, this was a fair trade. They waited tables, worked as lifeguards, fished, or played out their GI Bill stipend...anything to stay on the beach.</p>

                        <p>The seven-mile North Shore wave zone that began at Haleiwa was denser and more complex than any other like-sized area in the world, with breaks often shingled one on top of the other. It was overwhelming, particularly in the early years. A handful of locals surfers rode Haleiwa in the 1920s and early 1930s, but only the small nearshore waves. When they paddled out on a bigger day in 1938, Whitey Harrison and Tarzan Smith were rewarded with nothing more than a good long watery beating.</p>

                        <p>The North Shore was about the same distance from Waikiki as Makaha, but much easier to get to: drive straight across the island on the well-paved Kamehameha Highway, through the cane fields and past the tent rows at Schofield Barracks, then bear right, about one mile inland, just past the big gray smokestack at the Waialua Sugar Mill. </p>

                        <blockquote class="equip-merrick">Sunset Beach quickly revealed itself as the North Shore’s most consistent break. Like Makaha, Sunset is a right-breaking wave with a variety of component parts. Unlike Makaha, it takes shape as a wedge, not a wall; it has alternating steep and flat sections and a takeoff area that ranges fifty yards in any direction from wave to wave. Makaha Point Surf breaks with force equal to that of Sunset. But Sunset is a more complicated spot, and harder to ride.</blockquote>

                        <p>And so it went for the Empty Lot Boys and their hot curl converts, into the fall of 1941. They lived at a nearly surreal remove from the rest of the world, both geographically and psychologically. Jobs were still hard to come by in Honolulu. The war in Europe raged on. Japan was carving up Southeast Asia. None of that seemed to matter. The winter wave season had just arrived, and Hawaii’s surfing vanguard spent the first three weeks in December riding Makaha, or making plans to do so, and talking a lot about who had a faster board, Froiseth or Brown. These were the important things.</p>

                      <div class="description timeline">
                        <p>A rudimentary form of surfboard retailing began in 1949, when longtime Southern California surfer and boardmaker Dale Velzy opened a tiny factory-storefront in Manhattan Beach. His operation took off five years later, when he opened a bigger shop in Venice Beach, with fellow shaper Hap Jacobs, and they introduced the wildly popular Velzy-Jacobs “pig” model.</p>

                        <p>Velzy soon had competition from a 21-year-old boardmaker from Laguna Beach named Hobie Alter, who was as sober and organized as Velzy was flamboyant and impulsive. Alter built 80 boards during his first three years as a shaper—nothing close to Velzy’s numbers, but more by far than any other Orange County boardmaker. Not only were the boards well-crafted—even at this early stage, before Alter had come up with a decal, before he even signed his work—they were reasonably priced ($45) and always delivered on time, unlike the typical Velzy-Jacobs job.</p>

                        <p>In 1954 Alter bought a weedy vacant lot in an unincorporated Dana Point/Pacific Coast Highway “retail district” that featured just two other stores. Alter then built an L-shaped building, with a small but bright glass-fronted retail space and a windowless cement-walled factory attached to the back. Fifteen hundred Hobie boards [were] sold altogether between 1954 and early 1958, at a time when the total number of surfers in California wasn’t much above five thousand.</p>

                        <p>Velzy swooped down from Los Angeles in 1955 to open a new outlet in San Clemente, on Pacific Coast Highway, just five miles south of Hobie’s shop, for the express purpose of siphoning off potential customers driving up from San Diego. And thus began the start of the first great American boardmaker’s rivalry. Customers lined up behind one man or the other, Hobie or Velzy, giving their allegiance not just to a brand but a form of surfing leadership.</p>

                        <p>In the early 1950s, a handful of Honolulu surfers decided to tackle big-wave riding as a kind of Manhattan Project. John Kelly and the other original hot curlers had first ridden Makaha in 1937, and over the next fifteen years ambitious Hawaiians had continued making occasional day-trip visits to test themselves in incrementally bigger waves. They hadn’t made much progress, though, and the Makaha trip was always a risk.</p>

                        <p>Downing made a board he called the Rocket—a 10-foot, 35-pound, balsa-core beauty now regarded as the first great piece of specialized big-wave equipment. Made for the upcoming 1950-51 winter surf season at Makaha, the Rocket was essentially a hot curl crossed with a Malibu chip. Downing kept the hot curl’s streamlined shape, but flattened out the back hull, knowing that a non-rounded planing surface would run faster through the water.</p>

                        <blockquote class="equip-merrick">The board was fiberglassed, like the chip boards, and had a strange 10-inch redwood-lined slot routered into the bottom, near the tail. Downing had changed his mind about the fin, and was now convinced that it would be the key stabilizing feature in big surf, but he wanted to try a few different sizes and shapes—this “fin box” would allow him to experiment.</blockquote>

                        <p>It took Downing a few weeks (and a few cartwheeling Point Surf wipeouts) to come up with a fin solution, but from then on it was a big-wave surfer-surfboard partnership like no other. Downing rode the Rocket for ten years. “I had so much confidence in this board,” he later said, “that never once, if I got it trimming right, did I feel like I couldn’t make it to the end of the curl line.” In 2010, sixty years after launch, the Rocket still had a place in Downing’s board collection.</p>

Putman’s Sons published Gidget, the Little Girl with Big Ideas—the subtitle was dropped for later editions—in mid-fall 1957. It earned reasonably good notices (the Times called it “touching and entertaining”), made the West Coast best-seller lists (outperforming Jack Kerouac’s On the Road, which came out a few weeks earlier), and eventually sold more than a half million copies.</p>

                        <p>A 1957 Look magazine cover story on American teenagers promised to explain “why they go wild, why they don’t listen.” The latest popular entertainment certainly offered no relief: Jerry Lee Lewis onanisticly pounding away at his piano was just fractionally less shocking than Little Richard with his black-on-black eyeliner and screeched vocals; B-movies like Girl Gang, Dragstrip Riot, and Rumble on the Docks were cheap to make and bulletproof at the box-office.</p>

                        <p>Although surfing was one Cosmo’s body-beautifying outdoor activities, surfers were more likely to be grouped with bikers and hot-rodders than junior division skiers and tennis players. That was fine with surfers. Most Mainland wave-riders played the rebel to one degree or another, starting with hairstyle. The “surfer look” meant longer hair—all the way to the collar, in some cases—and to shortcut the natural sun-lightening process, the new style was to treat it with peroxide, ammonia, or bleach, leaving the product in until every last strand was blowtorch-white. At the local Salvation Army, surfers pawed through the women’s formal-wear racks in search of long fur coats, to be worn robe-like over surf trunks at the beach.</p>

                        <blockquote class="equip-merrick">“Things had changed from the era of the Palos Verdes Surf Club,” Greg Noll later summarized, “when the guys were polite and behaved like gentleman, to something else where we just wanted to raise hell. And it wasn’t a gradual change. It was like someone threw a switch, and all of a sudden guys didn’t give a shit about society, or what other people thought of them.”</blockquote>

                        <p>Still, while surfing bred a certain amount of genuine rebelliousness, mostly it produced a lot of rebel posing. Even with their bleached-blond hair, moldy fur coats, and spray-painted rattletrap cars, America’s teenage surfers as a rule remained contented sons of suburbia. On hot summer days they lobbed water balloons at their girlfriends and had doughnut-eating contests on the beach. They didn’t carry weapons. They didn’t drop out at a rate any higher than that of the high school population at large. They didn’t thrill ride themselves to a gory death on the streets and highways.</p>

                        <p>Not only was John Severson the go-to guy for surf logos and trademarks in the early '60s, he worked for free. Not because he was young and exploitable, but because he desperately needed to fill ad space for "The Surfer" — the rough little 36-page booklet that started off as a promo piece for his 1960 movie Surf Fever, and was later grandfathered in as the debut issue of Surfer magazine.</p>

                        <p>The Surfer wound up looking like a scruffy but earnest art school project, beginning with its horizontal format, grainy cover shot, and hand-lettered logotype. Doodled surf figures glide around the margins. Captions are often set vertically. Lots of real estate on any give page is left unprinted and white. Severson had always liked Doc Ball’s 1946 book California Surfriders, and he’d intended to make The Surfer a similar all-photo project.</p>

                        <blockquote class="equip-merrick">The Surfer went to press just before Easter in 1960. Still not quite sure if he’d created a magazine, a promo piece, or a book—the cover was initially going to be hardbound, but a cardboard stock was switched in at the last minute—Severson in the end ran a contents page subtitle describing The Surfer as his “First Annual Surf Photo Book.” His idea was that he’d follow up with a second edition in 1961 to go with next year’s surf film.</blockquote>

                        <p>Severson printed ten thousand copies of The Surfer at a total cost of $3,000; the per-unit wholesale cost was $1.00, and each issue retailed for $2.00—pricey for something not too far removed from a vanity project. When the 1960s surf boom arrived, Severson was the primary media gatekeeper between trade interests and surfers at large, and he went a long way toward making the transition less crass, if not less abrupt.

                        <p>Filmed in 1963 at the very height of the boom, <em>Endless Summer</em> wasn’t released to general audiences until fall 1966, at which point the movie played like a coda for a era of the sport that, rather than being endless, vanished almost instantly.</p>

                        <p>Brown’s premise was simple—follow two California surfers around the world in search of the perfect wave—and the end result had a casualness that almost seemed offhand. Brown picked his two surfers well. Robert August was Endless Summer’s calm, dark-haired goofyfooter. Mike Hynson was the grinning regularfooter with the permanently slicked-back blond hair.</p>

                        <p>Brown, August, and Hynson traveled light carrying one board each; Brown’s entire arsenal of camera gear, cases included, weighed less than a hundred pounds. There was no film crew. From California, over a four-month period, they circled the globe from west to east. They rode half-mile long waves in New Zealand, virgin reef surf in Senegal, and backwash swells in Tahiti. Hitting the most spectacular gusher in surf travel history, they also found what they'd gone looking for—the perfect wave—at a place called Cape St. Francis in South Africa.</p>

                        <p>Brown added the voice-over script during <em>Endless Summer’s</em> debut tour in 1964, when he screened the movie himself and did live narration. Technically the movie at that point was still a work in progress, and Brown often made small edits from one showing to the next, but the basic sequences were finished. So was all the subcontracted production work. A San Clemente band named the Sandals recorded the soundtrack, which included “Theme from Endless Summer”.</p>

                        <blockquote class="equip-merrick">Endless Summer presented real surfers traveling to real locations, and it couldn’t be described as anything other than a documentary. Except Brown didn’t really care about documenting his four-month trip around the world. What Brown wanted to do — what he did flawlessly — was present the look and feel of surfing in its best moments. In a way, Endless Summer was an impressionist work, and Brown was craftsman enough to arrange, conceal, accent, and outright invent as required.</blockquote>

                        <p>It may seem a bit grandiose that anything having to do with surfing should be called a “revolution,” but the late-'60s shortboard revolution was just that—in miniature, at least. Old ways and ideas were thrown over in a furious rush.</p>

                        <p>Surfboard design was the most obvious change. Boards went from bulky 9-foot 6-inch 26-pound noseriders to 6-foot 6-inch 9-pound “mind machines.” Shortboards had numerous practical advantages over what were soon called (and always disparagingly) “longboards.” They were easy to carry, fit anywhere in the house, and could be stowed inside a car—smaller versions even fit in the trunk.</p>

                        <blockquote class="equip-merrick">The shortboard revolution thundered across the surfing landscape for roughly three years, beginning in 1967. It was really two distinct but conjoined movements: one technical, the other cultural.</blockquote>

                        <p>Shortboards changed the game. Exploring those changes, finding and testing and resetting performance limits—this was an all-consuming mission of surfing in the late '60s. Hanging ten was out. Straight-line trim was out. Now it was all about fin-flexing bottom turns, “roller coaster” moves off the whitewater, and tucking yourself into the “green room”—otherwise known as the tube.</p>

                        <p>Equipment and performance, though, were just the leading edge of the shortboard revolution, which reshaped every last nook and cranny of the surf-world landscape, from fashion and language, to media and competition, to ritual and doctrine. Surfing during this period did its best to abdicate from the world of sport. Surfers practically melted into the counterculture, in ways both engaging and absurd. </p>

                        <p>But the period also brought a new hardness to beaches and lineups. A territorial practice called “localism” became an abiding surf-world presence. The sport's first drug fatalities were counted. Surfing’s ingrained cooler-than-you pettiness clocked up, and was worse for all the canned peace-and-brotherhood rhetoric.</p>

                        <p>Lines between Us and Them were sharply drawn. A lot of knives were hidden behind the peace banners. All to be expected, however. Revolution, as Chairman Mao said, is not a dinner party.</p>

                        <p>In 1975 groups like the Australian Surfriders Association, the Hawaiian Surfing Association, and the California-based Western Surfing Association had no affiliation with any national or international amateur athletic organization, but they were de facto amateur outfits nonetheless.</p>

                        <blockquote class="equip-merrick">Hawaii had four prize-money contests in 1973, and it led the early professional movement. (Eventually, the three biggest North Shore contests would be packaged together as the Triple Crown of Surfing, and winning the Triple Crown became a competitive achievement second only to the world title itself.)</blockquote>

                        <p>Some Hawaiian heavies, including a few pro surfers, had sworn vengeance on the Australians, who had swaggered a bit too freely after winning six of the seven North Shore events the previous year. </p>

                        <p>(Rabbit) Bartholomew arrived on October 1 and had no idea that anything was amiss. Two days later he was gang-beaten in the lineup at Sunset Beach. Local boardmakers were told not to sell or give equipment to any of the Australians. There were death threats, arson threats, and vague but believable rumors that the ill-will extended to Hawaiian mobsters.</p>

                        <p>A month went by. Bartholomew and Cairns spent much of their time behind locked doors at an expensive security-patrolled hotel a few miles east of the North Shore, until Eddie Aikau marched them in front of an ad hoc Hawaiian tribunal, where they were forced to recant and apologize. In return, they were allowed to surf in the North Shore contests.</p>

                        <p>Blood and violence, intimidation, trash-talking, kangaroo courts—this was the lead story for the 1976 Hawaiian surf season, not the launch of the IPS world tour. Townend’s world title "winner’s cup" was lifted from the Outrigger Canoe Club trophy case, hoisted up for a few newspaper photos—turned around so that the identifying plaque faced away from the camera—then quickly replaced. On the other hand, one year earlier there had been no world circuit at all.</p>

                        <p>Durban was on its way to becoming a favorite stop on the pre-IPS gypsy tour: overseas entrants for the 1974 Gunston 500 included Jeff Hakman, Ian Cairns, Reno Abellira, and new US champion Rick Rasmussen. All were impressed with what they saw. The local surfers ripped, and the Gunston itself was possibly the sport's best-organized contest.</p>

                        <blockquote class="equip-merrick">Surfers didn't fly to South Africa to experience Durban, though. They came for Jeffreys Bay, a remote pointbreak 500 miles to the southwest. </blockquote>

                        <p>Apartheid was the South African government’s official, codified, and strictly enforced policy of racial segregation. It lasted from 1948 to 1994. In the 1960s, most nations, including the United States, began to isolate South Africa, politically and socially, with an aim toward bringing apartheid down.</p>

                        <p>None of this affected surfing, however. South African surfers were for the most part able to compete anywhere they chose, and for Jeffreys-bound visitors apartheid was either ignored or breathtakingly rationalized.</p>

                        <p>In 1972, big-wave specialist Eddie Aikau was one of the invited contestants to the Gunston 500. Aikau was a full-blooded Hawaiian, with full lips, a broad nose, and skin dark enough to earn a polite but firm turnaround from the concierge at Durban’s Malibu Hotel, where he was supposed to meet Bill Hamilton and Jeff Hakman, two haole-Hawaiian pros who’d already checked in.</p>

                        <p>Aikau ended up staying in a beachfront apartment with Ernie Tomson, and seventeen-year-old Shaun. The Tomsons’ efforts on Aikau’s behalf were laudable—or at least civil. But it hardly proved that surfing could indeed “rise above politics.”</p>

                        <p>Aikau flew home after giving an interview with a black-owned South African newspaper in which he said, “The color problem in South Africa, man, is really heavy—I fear to walk in the streets.”</p>

                        <p>The political stink from the 1972 Gunston contest blew over quickly, and another 13 years would pass before apartheid again caught the attention of the broader surf world.</p>

                        <p>Before the IPS world tour, the top shortboard-era surfers—Nat Young, Midget Farrelly, Gerry Lopez, Reno Abellira, and Terry Fitzgerald among them—earned a living by shaping surfboards. Once the tour was established, aspiring pros had more incentive to focus entirely on wave-riding, and boardmaking fell by the wayside.</p>

                        <p>Mark Richards bucked this trend partly because, unlike Bartholomew, he wasn’t convinced that pro surfing was going to evolve into a career-worthy occupation. But he also just loved designing and crafting boards.</p>

                        <p>At first, his contest results suffered. Richards finished third in 1976 final ratings, dropped to fifth the next year, then fell all the way to tenth in 1978. It wasn’t just that he was learning a trade. He was learning a trade while competing on the tour. In addition, too many contests were held in small waves, and as one of the tour’s biggest surfers, Richards found himself bogging down more often than the smaller, lighter pros.</p>

                        <p>Hoping to put a bit of snap and fizz into his small-wave act, Richards, alone among the top Aussie pros, made the switch in 1975 to the “stinger” design, introduced a year earlier by Ben Aipa of Hawaii.</p>

                        <blockquote class="equip-merrick">Richards’ take on the design, however, was the one that counted. It went into high gear effortlessly, and the speed didn’t seem to burn off during a turn.</blockquote>

                        <p>In mid-'77 Richards built himself a 6-foot 2-inch stinger-fish hybrid. He put a lot of V in the back end—more than anybody else at the time. Most significantly, Richards finished the board off with a pair of modified fish-style fins, both angled slightly toward the nose. As a finishing touch, he ordered a new oversized surfboard label, with the initials “MR” airbrushed inside the familiar diamond-shaped yellow-and-red Superman logo.</p>

                        <p>It was a defining moment, not just for Richards and the still-germinal IPS tour, but for surfing as a whole. The new champion was living proof that the sport was a better place than it had been at the beginning of the decade. </p>

                        <p>In April 1981, just a few weeks before the Dewey Weber Longboard Classic, an oversized Aussie pro surfer and boardmaker named Simon Anderson walked down the stairs at Bells Beach holding a new type of board he’d winkingly called the “Thruster.” It was a peculiar-looking craft, with a narrow nose and three small fins placed in a triangular cluster.</p>

                        <p>To a casual observer, there was no reason to think the Thruster was any different, or more viable, than the hundred or so half-cocked ideas had flared briefly over the past fifteen years before winding up on the board design scrapheap. But Anderson was about to prove that this was something very different indeed.</p>

                        <blockquote class="equip-merrick">The tri-fin would in fact became the biggest surfboard design breakthrough since the shortboard revolution.</blockquote>

                        <p>The most distinctive feature of the new board was a stabilizing third fin, placed behind the side fins, along the stringer, just a couple of inches from the back end. Three-finned boards had been tried before: Dick Brewer and Reno Abellira of Hawaii had designed a version in 1970 that featured a standard-sized middle fin flanked by a pair of small half-moon “finlets.”</p>

                        <p>What Anderson did, in other words, was pull a tail design halfway out of thin air and patch it together with another shaper’s failed bit of nose design. Anderson called his new board the “Thruster.” He claimed it wasn’t a sexual double entendre. Nobody believed him.</p>

                        <p>“Bells was the real test,” Anderson said later. “We hadn’t really evolved yet to a place where you could start a bottom turn, aim up, and actually increase speed through your turn off the top. At Bells, all of a sudden, there it was.”<p>

                          <p>By the summer of 1982, the Thruster was being copied by every forward-thinking boardmaker in the sport and by 1983 it was being used almost universally on shortboards and was popular as well among longboarders. There was plenty of fine-tuning to come, but as of 2015 the tri-fin remains the standard board design.</p>

                          <p>Tom Carroll represented a surfing nation that had dominated the leaderboard since the pro tour's inception in 1976, and would continue to hold power for another 10 or so years.

                          <p>The two men hit it off, and in 1993, when Carroll announced he was retiring from the pro tour after fifteen exemplary years, Hawke was the featured speaker at Carroll's black-tie retirement dinner. “There is no Australian sporting hero or legend, at whose name I have a greater surge of affection and admiration than [that of] Tom Carroll,” Hawke said. “Thank you for what you’ve done for your sport.

                          <p>Until the mid-1990s, women’s surfing had muddled along as it had for the previous century—too small to get any real attention, but not small enough to be a novelty. 

                            <p>Women broke through on occasion: Gidget midwifed the original surf craze, world champion Joyce Hoffman emerged as a sports-world star in the midsixties, the Margo Oberg/Lynn Boyer rivalry helped to buoy the pro tour in the late seventies and early eighties. But these achievements never did much to put more females in the water.</p>

                            <p>In the three decades leading to the 1990s, women made up roughly 3 percent of the surfing population. Sexism, furthermore, remained the sport’s default setting. Female surfers never got the surf magazine cover shots, and they weren’t invited on sponsor-backed “photo-promo” trips or featured in surf movies and videos. Prize money for women pros remained a fraction of what it was for men, and their contest coverage was dispatched in a few dry sentences or ignored altogether.</p>

                            <p>The new age in women’s surfing was ushered in by an ambitious Floridian runaway named Lisa Andersen. In 1985, at age sixteen, she flew across the country, and landed in Huntington Beach, California.times.” She turned pro in 1987 and was immediately picked as a world-beater.</p>

                            <p>After giving birth to a daughter in 1993, Andersen surfed in a world-tour contest less than three weeks after being wheeled out of the delivery room. Five months later, she opened the 1994 season by either winning or placing runner-up in five consecutive events. She then rode well enough down the stretch—despite chronic lower back pain from constantly holding an infant on her hip—to win the world championship.</p>

                            <blockquote class="equip-merrick">“Lisa’s Style and Class” was the title of a fawning Surfing article, and Surfer put Andersen on the cover, blasting through a top turn, with a taunting male-aimed blurb: “Lisa Andersen Surfs Better Than You.” </blockquote>

                            <p>Outside’s 1996 feature on Andersen described her as the sport’s “first true female star, period.”</p>

                            <p>Over the course of his long career, Slater played guitar onstage with Pearl Jam, scored an Interview cover story, starred in his own PlayStation video game, was rendered in twenty-foot-high statuary, and made Hard Day’s Night–like escapes from screaming mobs of female fans. Bruce Weber photographed him. Cocoa Beach named a street in his honor.</p>

                            <p>On Surfer’s 2009 list of the fifty greatest surfers of all time, Slater finished on top. (Duke Kahanamoku placed second; Tom Curren third.) He dated, in order, Pamela Anderson, Gisele Bundchen, and Cameron Diaz. “He is, with absolutely no equivocation, the biggest surf star of the modern era,” one surf journalist said. “How utterly convenient that he is also the best wave-rider.”</p>

                            <p>Slater’s announcement that he would be turning pro in the summer of 1990 triggered a bidding war among surfing’s three biggest companies. He flew out to California and signed a deal with Quiksilver worth close to $200,000 annually. Slater convincingly won his first event as a professional, a non-ASP contest held at Trestles, at one point scoring three perfect 10s in a single heat.</p>

                            <blockquote class="equip-merrick">Kelly Slater was the youngest men’s division world-tour champion at twenty years old. He would go on to win a total of 11 World Championship victories including 5 consecutive world titles in 1994-98.</blockquote>

                            <p>Slater’s rise didn’t happen in a vacuum. Another dozen or so young pro-grade teenagers were riding the same kind of feathery boards to the same inventive purpose. Somebody called them the “New School” and the name stuck. Among the best were Shane Powell of Australia, a fearless Big Island regularfooter named Shane Dorian, and San Diego’s Rob Machado, who kept a Lopez–like sense of flow even while twisting through the latest upside-down and backward move.</p>

                            <p>The geography of big-wave riding began to shift in the 1980s, with the discovery of a break called Killers, located on Todos Santos, a small uninhabited island just a few miles off the Baja California port town of Ensenada.</p>

                            <p>It was a given that Hawaii, uniquely positioned as it was to the North Pacific storm track—close enough to bring in the power; distant enough that swells had time to groom themselves—was the only place in the world able to produce huge, clean, rideable waves. This still isn’t wrong. No other coastal region can match Hawaii for big-wave consistency, and only here are big-wave breaks found in clusters. The North Shore alone is home to at least six reefs capable of producing twenty-five-foot waves. Still, Todos Santos and Pico Alto expanded big-wave surfing’s horizons. There were other big waves out there, everybody suddenly realized. Maybe lots of them.</p>

                            <blockquote class="equip-merrick">From above, the Maverick’s reef looks like a huge upside-down check mark: an abrupt left explodes along the short arm, to the north, while a much longer south-running right bowls across the long arm, often passing through two or three distinct sections.</blockquote>

                            <p>This point was irrevocably brought home by a California break called Maverick’s, which looked more powerful, and more challenging, than anything in Hawaii. Located next to Pillar Point Harbor, about twenty-five miles south of San Francisco, Maverick’s had long been the private big-wave domain for a terse Half Moon Bay carpenter named Jeff Clark.</p>

                            <p>There are added degrees of difficulty. Visibility is often reduced by fog. Winter ocean temperatures can drop to the upper 40s, and the air temperature can go even lower.For the finishing touch, Half Moon Bay is located on the eastern edge of what has long been referred to as the “red triangle”—a cold, murky nearshore tract of Pacific bordered by Monterey, Tomales Bay, and the Farallon Islands, known to have the world’s highest concentration of white sharks.</p>

                            <p>Laird Hamilton’s Millennium Wave was the first real test of surfing’s Digital Age preparedness. Less than forty-eight hours after the event, photos of the ride, converted to low-res files, were attached to emails and sent to a handful of surf magazine editors. Within three or four days the images had landed in every surf-industry hard drive from Torquay to Tokyo.</p>

                            <p>Since all identifying notes and remarks had been removed from the digital image at some early point in the distribution chain, the photos turned up on most computer screens unadorned; lots of recipients thought the whole thing was a well-crafted Photoshop hoax.</p>

                            <p>A week later, Surfer won a bidding war for a video clip of Hamilton’s ride, which was immediately posted on its Web site. By the time Surfer ran the Millennium Wave as a gatefold cover on the February 2001 issue, tens of thousands of surf-world Internet gawkers had already given themselves a headache from repeatedly watching a small, fuzzy, color-drained version on their PCs.</p>

                            <blockquote class="equip-merrick">It didn’t take long for this new media source to go from novel to essential. By the early 2000s, online cameras and reports were a universal part of the surfing world.</blockquote>

                            <p>Surfline, the popular Huntington-based wave report and forecasting service, went online in 1995, but originally the site was nothing more than a modem-channeled version of its 800-phone service. Things picked up two years later, when Surfline and a few other similar companies put up the first around-the-clock live-stream “surf cams.”</p>

                            <p>Surfing began to retrieve and recycle its past decades earlier, when the longboard was so enthusiastically put back into play, and the process continued with the return of big-wave riding. The sport was broader, more interesting, and more inclusive for these efforts. Introduced in the 1990s, the “retro movement” began as a self-amused, half-ironic fashion trek to the soul-surfing headwaters of the late-sixties and seventies.</p>

                            <blockquote class="equip-merrick">The retro movement tapped into a broader desire among surfers everywhere for an alternative presentation—one that didn’t involve competition, ratings, logo overkill, and gratuitous aggression.</blockquote>

                            <p>Longboarding’s place in the retro movement was a little hard to pin down. In general, shortboarders and longboarders still didn’t have much to do with each other, and plenty of breaks remained segregated. But tensions between the two groups had eased over the decades.</p>

                            <p>Furthermore, a young and conspicuously hip new generation of longboarders had arrived, and Joel Tudor of San Diego, the group’s best-known member, had for better and worse become surfing’s poster boy for all things retro.</p>

                            <p>Greater variety in surfboard equipment, and more attention to riding style—neither of these ideas should have been “retro” to begin with. But they were, and it’s much to Tudor’s credit that both were back in vogue—along with paisley-covered boards and the Nixon-era beavertail wetsuit—as surfing glided into the 21st century.</p>

                            <p>Surfing was the most radiantly cinematic activity to ever light up a screen, but by the early 1990s, surf movies as a rule weren’t looking much better than America’s Funniest Home Videos. Quality had plummeted in the previous decade as movies were replaced by the VHS cassette, and as filmmakers began shooting directly on videotape.</p>

                            <p>Typically, surf videos were available in surf shops or by mail order. Low sales figures were the rule—few titles went above five thousand units—thanks mostly to rampant bootlegging. Then again, production costs were so low that a videographer could move just a few hundred copies and still turn a profit.</p>

                            <p>The dynamic wasn’t much changed with the advent of DVDs and video downloads. Cheap and dirty Momentum-like videos were too easy to make, and too popular with groms wanting a quick surf-action fix; low-cost and fast access would always trump production niceties for a large segment of the surfing population.</p>

                            <blockquote class="equip-merrick">People were no longer starved for surf imagery—and never would be again, thanks to the Internet. Still, the return of the traveling surf movie was a welcome development.</blockquote>

                            <p>But a trend developed in the late nineties toward better-crafted, McCoy-style projects—or as journalist Steve Barilotti put it, there was a “gradual shift back from wave-riding porn to surfing-as-art-film.”</p>

                            <p>Part of the success was due to what Barilotti called a “surf cinema mini-renaissance,” as more ambitious producers began making short four-wall tours up and down the coast. For his 2004 film Blue Horizon, Jack McCoy went so far as to do live narration. Surf moviegoing was no longer the boozed-up, semi-combustible happening it had been during the barnstorming era. The big screen, everyone suddenly remembered, loved the sport. Always had, always would.</p>
