It was overwhelming, particularly in the early years. A handful of locals surfers rode Haleiwa in the 1920s and early 1930s, but only the small nearshore waves.</p>

        <p>A rudimentary form of surfboard retailing began in 1949, when longtime Southern California surfer and boardmaker Dale Velzy opened a tiny factory-storefront in Manhattan Beach. In 1954, after two or three quiet surveillance trips to Velzy’s shop, and with a $1,000 gift from his father, Hobie Alter opened a shop in Dana Point/Pacific Coast Highway “retail district” and a sufboard building rivalry was born.</p>

        <p>In the early 1950s, a handful of Honolulu surfers decided to tackle big-wave riding as a kind of Manhattan Project. John Kelly and the other original hot curlers had first ridden Makaha in 1937, and over the next fifteen years ambitious Hawaiians had continued making occasional day-trip visits to test themselves in incrementally bigger waves.</p>

And it wasn’t a gradual change. It was like someone threw a switch, and all of a sudden guys didn’t give a shit about society, or what other people thought of them.”</p>

This original surf-lust, as much as the islands’ accrued developments in board design and riding technique, is what marks Hawaii as surfing’s birthplace.</p>

                        <p>“All thought of work is at an end,” a nineteenth-century Hawaiian scholar wrote, describing his ancestors’ wave-riding fervency in terms recognizable to any hardcore twenty-first-century surfer. “The wife may go hungry, [and] the children . . . but the head of the house does not care. All day there is nothing but surfing.”</p>

                        <p>Not much is known about Gurrey's early life. He was born (1874) in Kansas, and took an engineering degree from the University of California, Berkeley, before moving with his family to Hawaii, probably around 1899. Shortly after he married Caroline Haskins, a nationally known portrait photographer, and the two operated a series of galleries in Honolulu for the next two decades.</p>

                        <p>Gurrey took to surfing shortly after arriving in Honolulu, and became a member of the Hui Nalu surf club, where he shared waves with Duke Kahanmoku, and began to photograph his fellow surfers. Most of Gurrey's shots are taken from the side; taken from a pier, or from a canoe riding alonside his subjects. His work first appeared in surfing promoter Alexander Hume Ford's publication Mid-Pacific Magazine, in 1911. A few years later Gurrey collected the best of his photographs and included them in The Surf Riders of Hawaii. The booklet is roughly 7" x 7", contains eight board-mounted gelatin-silver images, and a short block of Gurrey-penned text on surfing.</p>

                        <p>In 1929, Tom Blake built the first waterproof camera housing used exclusively for surf photography. Most previous surfing photos had been taken from canoes or boats but Blake produced images from the unique perspective of a surfboard. Many of his early images were published internationally. He used his own photographs to illustrate his first book. National Geographic magazine was so taken by his work they featured a number of his images in an article published in 1935.</p>

                        <p>"I bought a 4x5 graflex camera from Duke Kahanamoku in 1929," as Blake recalls the event. "I built a big wooden box about two feet high around it and placed the controls on the outside. The idea was to shoot surfing photos from my board. It was crude and clumsy. The lens would fog up so I placed a wiper on the inside of the box's lens. I managed to get some pretty good shots and everybody wanted their photo taken. It really took off when I sent the L.A.Times some images. In January of 1931, they ran a full page spread in their Sunday photogravure section. It was called "Riders Of The Sunset Seas." This image got Doc Ball and Dr. Don James so excited they both eventually became well known surf photographers."</p>

                        <p>Surf club membership wasn’t mandatory for California surfers, but by the late 1930s you could have driven a Packard Super 8 from San Diego to Santa Cruz and had a hard time loading it up with nonaffiliated surfers. California’s best-known and best-organized group was the Palos Verdes Surf Club, founded in 1935 by a surfing dentist named John “Doc” Ball. Just under thirty surfers took the club oath and became PVSC members during the 1930s. A dozen other similar clubs were formed up and down the coast, every one filled with young gung-ho middle-class surfers, roughly half of them college students.</p>

                        <p>With clubs on the rise, surfing took another inevitable step toward organized competition, which meant rules and standings, winners and losers, trophies and championships—the staff of life to sportsmen of all kind.</p>

                        <blockquote class="equip-merrick">Also, there was a flattery inherent in the rise of club-sponsored events, contests, and newsletters, in that they all promised to put the surfer at the center of the action. In a social and cultural sense, this was essential to the development of the sport. But it didn’t reflect the surfer’s experience in the water, which constantly veered into the wild, to places that had nothing to do with any regulated or organized form of sport.</blockquote>

                      <div class="description timeline">
                        <p>Why did Southern California give birth to a national surfing craze? One simple, attractive, ahistorical, quasi-magical explanation is that modern surfing conjured itself into existence from the perfect air that hung over the perfect beach next to the perfect waves at Malibu. Surfing actually made Malibu, but never mind. From the late 1940s to the early 1960s, it often seemed to be the other way around.</p>

                        <p>Just like at Waikiki and San Onofre, Malibu changed the sport on the land as well as in the water. This sandy hook of beachfront would in fact be surf culture’s last and greatest site-specific incubator. Loose-fitting clothes, bouncy slang, pride in the sport’s detachment from other sports (and the insolence that comes with that pride), a default wariness toward other surfers, flashing public nudity and other forms of mild social rebellion—a good part of the surfer stylebook was drafted at Malibu, beginning in 1945.</p>

                        <blockquote>No surf break, then or now, has ever presented itself as well as Malibu. Each wave rolled forth as if it had traveled halfway across the Pacific for the express purpose of gliding into this quarter-mile bit of shoreline.</blockquote>

                        <p>In a complete turnaround from the 1930s, surfers no longer showed any interest in organizing the sport through clubs or competitions. At this point, surfing had been part of Southern California’s recreational landscape for forty years. It had its own history, and was beginning to take on the heft of permanence, which likely helped the Malibu surfers make a bigger commitment to the sport. Lounging on the beach was a harder act to justify during the postwar prosperity boom than it had been during the Depression. In 1937, it was possible to ride waves for hours a day because there wasn’t much else to do. In 1947, serious water time was paid for with reduced paychecks and a much-shortened list of job choices. For a lot of surfers, this was a fair trade. They waited tables, worked as lifeguards, fished, or played out their GI Bill stipend...anything to stay on the beach.</p>

                        <p>The seven-mile North Shore wave zone that began at Haleiwa was denser and more complex than any other like-sized area in the world, with breaks often shingled one on top of the other. It was overwhelming, particularly in the early years. A handful of locals surfers rode Haleiwa in the 1920s and early 1930s, but only the small nearshore waves. When they paddled out on a bigger day in 1938, Whitey Harrison and Tarzan Smith were rewarded with nothing more than a good long watery beating.</p>

                        <p>The North Shore was about the same distance from Waikiki as Makaha, but much easier to get to: drive straight across the island on the well-paved Kamehameha Highway, through the cane fields and past the tent rows at Schofield Barracks, then bear right, about one mile inland, just past the big gray smokestack at the Waialua Sugar Mill. </p>

                        <blockquote class="equip-merrick">Sunset Beach quickly revealed itself as the North Shore’s most consistent break. Like Makaha, Sunset is a right-breaking wave with a variety of component parts. Unlike Makaha, it takes shape as a wedge, not a wall; it has alternating steep and flat sections and a takeoff area that ranges fifty yards in any direction from wave to wave. Makaha Point Surf breaks with force equal to that of Sunset. But Sunset is a more complicated spot, and harder to ride.</blockquote>

                        <p>And so it went for the Empty Lot Boys and their hot curl converts, into the fall of 1941. They lived at a nearly surreal remove from the rest of the world, both geographically and psychologically. Jobs were still hard to come by in Honolulu. The war in Europe raged on. Japan was carving up Southeast Asia. None of that seemed to matter. The winter wave season had just arrived, and Hawaii’s surfing vanguard spent the first three weeks in December riding Makaha, or making plans to do so, and talking a lot about who had a faster board, Froiseth or Brown. These were the important things.</p>

                      <div class="description timeline">
                        <p>A rudimentary form of surfboard retailing began in 1949, when longtime Southern California surfer and boardmaker Dale Velzy opened a tiny factory-storefront in Manhattan Beach. His operation took off five years later, when he opened a bigger shop in Venice Beach, with fellow shaper Hap Jacobs, and they introduced the wildly popular Velzy-Jacobs “pig” model.</p>

                        <p>Velzy soon had competition from a 21-year-old boardmaker from Laguna Beach named Hobie Alter, who was as sober and organized as Velzy was flamboyant and impulsive. Alter built 80 boards during his first three years as a shaper—nothing close to Velzy’s numbers, but more by far than any other Orange County boardmaker. Not only were the boards well-crafted—even at this early stage, before Alter had come up with a decal, before he even signed his work—they were reasonably priced ($45) and always delivered on time, unlike the typical Velzy-Jacobs job.</p>

                        <p>In 1954 Alter bought a weedy vacant lot in an unincorporated Dana Point/Pacific Coast Highway “retail district” that featured just two other stores. Alter then built an L-shaped building, with a small but bright glass-fronted retail space and a windowless cement-walled factory attached to the back. Fifteen hundred Hobie boards [were] sold altogether between 1954 and early 1958, at a time when the total number of surfers in California wasn’t much above five thousand.</p>

                        <p>Velzy swooped down from Los Angeles in 1955 to open a new outlet in San Clemente, on Pacific Coast Highway, just five miles south of Hobie’s shop, for the express purpose of siphoning off potential customers driving up from San Diego. And thus began the start of the first great American boardmaker’s rivalry. Customers lined up behind one man or the other, Hobie or Velzy, giving their allegiance not just to a brand but a form of surfing leadership.</p>

                        <p>In the early 1950s, a handful of Honolulu surfers decided to tackle big-wave riding as a kind of Manhattan Project. John Kelly and the other original hot curlers had first ridden Makaha in 1937, and over the next fifteen years ambitious Hawaiians had continued making occasional day-trip visits to test themselves in incrementally bigger waves. They hadn’t made much progress, though, and the Makaha trip was always a risk.</p>

                        <p>Downing made a board he called the Rocket—a 10-foot, 35-pound, balsa-core beauty now regarded as the first great piece of specialized big-wave equipment. Made for the upcoming 1950-51 winter surf season at Makaha, the Rocket was essentially a hot curl crossed with a Malibu chip. Downing kept the hot curl’s streamlined shape, but flattened out the back hull, knowing that a non-rounded planing surface would run faster through the water.</p>

                        <blockquote class="equip-merrick">The board was fiberglassed, like the chip boards, and had a strange 10-inch redwood-lined slot routered into the bottom, near the tail. Downing had changed his mind about the fin, and was now convinced that it would be the key stabilizing feature in big surf, but he wanted to try a few different sizes and shapes—this “fin box” would allow him to experiment.</blockquote>

                        <p>It took Downing a few weeks (and a few cartwheeling Point Surf wipeouts) to come up with a fin solution, but from then on it was a big-wave surfer-surfboard partnership like no other. Downing rode the Rocket for ten years. “I had so much confidence in this board,” he later said, “that never once, if I got it trimming right, did I feel like I couldn’t make it to the end of the curl line.” In 2010, sixty years after launch, the Rocket still had a place in Downing’s board collection.</p>

By the end of summer she had her own board and had developed into a competent surfer.</p> 

                        <p>Back home, she talked incessantly about her surfing experiences, and at one point told her father that she was going to write a book about it. Frederick Kohner smiled, heard a little bell go off in his head, and offered to write it for her.</p>

                        <p>Gidget is a work of fiction, but just barely. G. P. Putman’s Sons published Gidget, the Little Girl with Big Ideas—the subtitle was dropped for later editions—in mid-fall 1957. It earned reasonably good notices (the Times called it “touching and entertaining”), made the West Coast best-seller lists (outperforming Jack Kerouac’s On the Road, which came out a few weeks earlier), and eventually sold more than a half million copies.</p>

                        <p>A 1957 Look magazine cover story on American teenagers promised to explain “why they go wild, why they don’t listen.” The latest popular entertainment certainly offered no relief: Jerry Lee Lewis onanisticly pounding away at his piano was just fractionally less shocking than Little Richard with his black-on-black eyeliner and screeched vocals; B-movies like Girl Gang, Dragstrip Riot, and Rumble on the Docks were cheap to make and bulletproof at the box-office.</p>

                        <p>Although surfing was one Cosmo’s body-beautifying outdoor activities, surfers were more likely to be grouped with bikers and hot-rodders than junior division skiers and tennis players. That was fine with surfers. Most Mainland wave-riders played the rebel to one degree or another, starting with hairstyle. The “surfer look” meant longer hair—all the way to the collar, in some cases—and to shortcut the natural sun-lightening process, the new style was to treat it with peroxide, ammonia, or bleach, leaving the product in until every last strand was blowtorch-white. At the local Salvation Army, surfers pawed through the women’s formal-wear racks in search of long fur coats, to be worn robe-like over surf trunks at the beach.</p>

                        <blockquote class="equip-merrick">“Things had changed from the era of the Palos Verdes Surf Club,” Greg Noll later summarized, “when the guys were polite and behaved like gentleman, to something else where we just wanted to raise hell. And it wasn’t a gradual change. It was like someone threw a switch, and all of a sudden guys didn’t give a shit about society, or what other people thought of them.”</blockquote>

                        <p>Still, while surfing bred a certain amount of genuine rebelliousness, mostly it produced a lot of rebel posing. Even with their bleached-blond hair, moldy fur coats, and spray-painted rattletrap cars, America’s teenage surfers as a rule remained contented sons of suburbia. On hot summer days they lobbed water balloons at their girlfriends and had doughnut-eating contests on the beach. They didn’t carry weapons. They didn’t drop out at a rate any higher than that of the high school population at large. They didn’t thrill ride themselves to a gory death on the streets and highways.</p>

                        <p>Not only was John Severson the go-to guy for surf logos and trademarks in the early '60s, he worked for free. Not because he was young and exploitable, but because he desperately needed to fill ad space for "The Surfer" — the rough little 36-page booklet that started off as a promo piece for his 1960 movie Surf Fever, and was later grandfathered in as the debut issue of Surfer magazine.</p>

                        <p>The Surfer wound up looking like a scruffy but earnest art school project, beginning with its horizontal format, grainy cover shot, and hand-lettered logotype. Doodled surf figures glide around the margins. Captions are often set vertically. Lots of real estate on any give page is left unprinted and white. Severson had always liked Doc Ball’s 1946 book California Surfriders, and he’d intended to make The Surfer a similar all-photo project.</p>

                        <blockquote class="equip-merrick">The Surfer went to press just before Easter in 1960. Still not quite sure if he’d created a magazine, a promo piece, or a book—the cover was initially going to be hardbound, but a cardboard stock was switched in at the last minute—Severson in the end ran a contents page subtitle describing The Surfer as his “First Annual Surf Photo Book.” His idea was that he’d follow up with a second edition in 1961 to go with next year’s surf film.</blockquote>

                        <p>Severson printed ten thousand copies of The Surfer at a total cost of $3,000; the per-unit wholesale cost was $1.00, and each issue retailed for $2.00—pricey for something not too far removed from a vanity project. When the 1960s surf boom arrived, Severson was the primary media gatekeeper between trade interests and surfers at large, and he went a long way toward making the transition less crass, if not less abrupt. </p>

                        <p>Filmed in 1963 at the very height of the boom, <em>Endless Summer</em> wasn’t released to general audiences until fall 1966, at which point the movie played like a coda for a era of the sport that, rather than being endless, vanished almost instantly.</p>

                        <p>Brown’s premise was simple—follow two California surfers around the world in search of the perfect wave—and the end result had a casualness that almost seemed offhand. Brown picked his two surfers well. Robert August was Endless Summer’s calm, dark-haired goofyfooter. Mike Hynson was the grinning regularfooter with the permanently slicked-back blond hair.</p>

                        <p>Brown, August, and Hynson traveled light carrying one board each; Brown’s entire arsenal of camera gear, cases included, weighed less than a hundred pounds. There was no film crew. From California, over a four-month period, they circled the globe from west to east. They rode half-mile long waves in New Zealand, virgin reef surf in Senegal, and backwash swells in Tahiti. Hitting the most spectacular gusher in surf travel history, they also found what they'd gone looking for—the perfect wave—at a place called Cape St. Francis in South Africa.</p>

                        <p>Brown added the voice-over script during <em>Endless Summer’s</em> debut tour in 1964, when he screened the movie himself and did live narration. Technically the movie at that point was still a work in progress, and Brown often made small edits from one showing to the next, but the basic sequences were finished. So was all the subcontracted production work. A San Clemente band named the Sandals recorded the soundtrack, which included “Theme from Endless Summer”.</p>

                        <blockquote class="equip-merrick">Endless Summer presented real surfers traveling to real locations, and it couldn’t be described as anything other than a documentary. Except Brown didn’t really care about documenting his four-month trip around the world. What Brown wanted to do — what he did flawlessly — was present the look and feel of surfing in its best moments. In a way, Endless Summer was an impressionist work, and Brown was craftsman enough to arrange, conceal, accent, and outright invent as required.</blockquote>

                        <p>It may seem a bit grandiose that anything having to do with surfing should be called a “revolution,” but the late-'60s shortboard revolution was just that—in miniature, at least. Old ways and ideas were thrown over in a furious rush.</p>

                        <p>Surfboard design was the most obvious change. Boards went from bulky 9-foot 6-inch 26-pound noseriders to 6-foot 6-inch 9-pound “mind machines.” Shortboards had numerous practical advantages over what were soon called (and always disparagingly) “longboards.” They were easy to carry, fit anywhere in the house, and could be stowed inside a car—smaller versions even fit in the trunk.</p>

                        <blockquote class="equip-merrick">The shortboard revolution thundered across the surfing landscape for roughly three years, beginning in 1967. It was really two distinct but conjoined movements: one technical, the other cultural.</blockquote>

                        <p>Shortboards changed the game. Exploring those changes, finding and testing and resetting performance limits—this was an all-consuming mission of surfing in the late '60s. Hanging ten was out. Straight-line trim was out. Now it was all about fin-flexing bottom turns, “roller coaster” moves off the whitewater, and tucking yourself into the “green room”—otherwise known as the tube.</p>

                        <p>Equipment and performance, though, were just the leading edge of the shortboard revolution, which reshaped every last nook and cranny of the surf-world landscape, from fashion and language, to media and competition, to ritual and doctrine. Surfing during this period did its best to abdicate from the world of sport. Surfers practically melted into the counterculture, in ways both engaging and absurd. </p>

                        <p>But the period also brought a new hardness to beaches and lineups. A territorial practice called “localism” became an abiding surf-world presence. The sport's first drug fatalities were counted. Surfing’s ingrained cooler-than-you pettiness clocked up, and was worse for all the canned peace-and-brotherhood rhetoric.</p>

                        <p>Lines between Us and Them were sharply drawn. A lot of knives were hidden behind the peace banners. All to be expected, however. Revolution, as Chairman Mao said, is not a dinner party.</p>
