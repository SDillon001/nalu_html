        <p id="col" class="about text">This website for surfers and non-surfers alike who love the sport of surfing and the culture that surrounds it. This website provides an interactive way for you to learn more about how the sport of surfing has evolved over the years and how changes in surf photography have influenced some of those changes. Current websites featuring surfing and its history tend to be non-interactive and very word heavy, forcing the user to slog through long sections of text. The History of Surfing and Surf Photography is  an educational site with a documentary feel, communicating with users through beautiful photography, info-graphics, and video to provide a fun, informative, and interactive experience.</p>
