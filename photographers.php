                <h3>Bruce Brown</h3>

              <article>
                <p>Oscar-nominated surf moviemaker from Southern California; producer of 1966's The Endless Summer, the sport's best and best-known movie. Brown was born (1937) in San Francisco, California, spent his first nine years in Oakland, then moved with his family to Long Beach, in southwest Los Angeles County, where he began surfing.</p>

                <p>Brown himself made his first surf movie, an 8-millimeter short, while stationed on a navy submarine in Honolulu in 1955; two years later, back in California, surfboard-maker Dale Velzy bought Brown a new 16-millimeter movie camera and paid his way to Hawaii to shoot Slippery When Wet, Brown's first feature-length surf film. Slippery was easygoing, colorful, neatly edited, and scored by West Coast jazz favorite Bud Shank—but the movie was in large part defined by Brown's smooth and casual narration. Brown, Browne, Greg Noll, and John Severson were the only surf filmmakers at the time.</p>

                <p>Brown's fifth movie, Waterlogged, was a rush-job compilation film that gave Brown something to put on the market in 1963. That year he set out with California surfers Mike Hynson and Robert August to film The Endless Summer, a semidocumentary on "the search for the perfect wave." The $50,000 film debuted in the summer of 1964 and was shown in the same manner as Brown's previous films, on the beach-city circuit, with Brown himself driving from auditorium to auditorium to do live-narration screenings. He added a recorded narration in 1965 and showed the movie in Wichita, Kansas, where for two weeks it outsold My Fair Lady.</p>

                <p>In 1992 he came out of retirement to begin work on Endless Summer II. Unlike the original, the sequel was backed by a studio (New Line), and had a Hollywood budget ($3.5 million) as well as a film crew. But the new movie, while beautifully photographed, didn't have the magic of the original. "Brown isn't as well-versed as he once was," Surfer magazine wrote in its review, "and his narration, so effortless and warm in the late '50s and early '60s, now sounds a little forced." Brown had in a way become the victim of his own success; virtually every post-1964 surf movie had borrowed from Endless Summer, and the genre itself seemed to be played out. Brown, meanwhile, claimed his experience with New Line had been awful, and that his moviemaking days were through.</p>

                <p>Brown was the top vote-getter in the Motion Picture/Photography category of the 1966 International Surfing Magazine's Hall of Fame Awards; in 1994 he received the Waterman Achievement Award from the Surf Industry Manufacturers Association. In 1997 he was presented with a lifetime achievement award at the Surfer Magazine Video Awards banquet, and was profiled in 50 Years of Surfing on Film, a 1997 cable TV series produced by Opper Films and The Surfer's Journal. Two years later, Surfer named Brown the sport's fifth most influential surfer of all time. He was inducted into the Surfer's Hall of Fame in Huntington Beach in 2009.</p>

                <h3>Tom Blake</h3>

                <article>
                <p>Blake was born (1902) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the son of a club steward and former bar owner. His mother died of tuberculosis when Blake was an infant, and his father left him to be raised by a series of Milwaukee-based relatives. Isolated as a child, Blake grew up to become a quiet and detached adult. At age nine or 10, he saw a newsreel featuring a short clip of surfing in Hawaii; at 18, as a high school dropout living in Detroit, Michigan, he met Hawaiian surfer and Olympic gold medal swimmer Duke Kahanamoku in a movie theater lobby. Blake moved to Los Angeles the following year where he began swimming competitively, and was soon one of the nation's best all-arounders, winning a 10-mile AAU race in 1922, and later defeating Kahanamoku himself in a 220-yard sprint.</p>

                <p>Blake also helped develop surf photography and journalism. A few months after buying a Graflex camera from Duke Kahanamoku in 1929, he crafted a first-of-its-kind camera housing for use in the surf, and in 1931 one of his from-the-water Waikiki surf photos was published as a full-page image in the Los Angeles Times. In 1935, National Geographic published "Waves and Thrills at Waikiki," an eight-page portfolio of Blake's surfing photography; his Hawaiian Surfboard, the first book on surfing, was also published that year, with sections on history, board construction, competition, and wave-riding tips. Blake also wrote a soft-cover Manual of Surfboard Technique (1935), as well as DIY board making articles for Popular Mechanics (1936) and Popular Science (1939). Blake himself, as handsome as he was innovative, was often written about and photographed for newspaper and magazine articles.</p>

                <p>Blake continued to work as a lifeguard into his early 60s, mainly in Florida; in 1967 he returned to his childhood home in Wisconsin, where he wrote "Voice of the Wave," a religious-themed essay on surfing, published in a 1969 issue of Surfing magazine and later reworked into "Voice of the Atom." The essential Blake philosophy, one that he carved into stone in Wisconsin, came to be: Nature = God. Blake, a vegetarian from early adulthood, died in 1994 at age 92. He was married once, for less than a month, in 1925, and had no children.</p>

                <p>Blake was inducted into International Surfing Magazine's Hall of Fame in 1967, to the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1992, and to the Huntington Beach Surfing Walk of Fame in 1994. Tom Blake: Surfing 1922–1932, a book of photographs of and by Blake, was published in 1999. Tom Blake: The Uncommon Journey of a Pioneer Waterman, a richly detailed biography by Gary Lynch and Malcolm Gault-Williams, was published in 2001. Portions of a 1990 videotaped interview with Blake were used in Great Waves, an cable TV documentary series produced by Opper Films. Some of the luster came off the Blake legend when H2O magazine in 2001 reported that he "favored certain now-scientifically discredited and controversial beliefs regarding race and ethnicity."</p>
