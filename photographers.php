        <h3>Bruce Brown</h3>
        <p>Oscar-nominated surf moviemaker from Southern California; producer of 1966's The Endless Summer, the sport's best and best-known movie. Brown was born (1937) in San Francisco, California, spent his first nine years in Oakland, then moved with his family to Long Beach, in southwest Los Angeles County, where he began surfing.</p>

        <h3>Tom Blake</h3>
        <p>Blake was born (1902) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the son of a club steward and former bar owner. His mother died of tuberculosis when Blake was an infant, and his father left him to be raised by a series of Milwaukee-based relatives. Isolated as a child, Blake grew up to become a quiet and detached adult. At age nine or 10, he saw a newsreel featuring a short clip of surfing in Hawaii; at 18, as a high school dropout living in Detroit, Michigan, he met Hawaiian surfer and Olympic gold medal swimmer Duke Kahanamoku in a movie theater lobby. Blake moved to Los Angeles the following year where he began swimming competitively, and was soon one of the nation's best all-arounders, winning a 10-mile AAU race in 1922, and later defeating Kahanamoku himself in a 220-yard sprint.</p>

       <h3>Doc Ball</h3>
       <p>Prototype surf photographer and surf club organizer from Los Angeles, California; founder of the Palos Verdes Surf Club in 1935; author of the seminal 1946-published California Surfriders. While Ball and Wisconsin-born Tom Blake are both credited as the forebears of surf photography, it was Ball who had the greater influence on the next generation of photographers, including fellow California surf world icons Leroy Grannis and Don James. "The quality of his shots was superb," James later said of Ball's work. "I always wanted to try and get photos as good as Doc's, and I never quite made it."</p>

                          <p>My mom was a War Bride but she grew up in Australia and was a Bondi beach girl.  She always took us to the beach when we were kids and she was the only mom I knew that actually went in the ocean!  She body surfed well into her mid 60’s until she broke her arm colliding with a boogie boarder while body surfing.

                                  <p>Joseph O'Connor is a hyper-talented NY-based photographer with a knack for capturing the natural beauty ingrained into the south shore of Long Island.</p>

                                  <p>Born and raised in Long Beach, NY, he naturally developed a strong connection with the ocean, one that most people know pairs ever so eloquently with a passion for photography. His journey in photography began when his dad began teaching him how use a Pentax Super Program 35mm film camera during his high school years. Joseph's father loved capturing film photos of lighthouses and small coastal towns in the northeast, especially Maine.  It was these early forays into photographic expression that inspired a lot of what Joe enjoys shooting today.</p>

                                  <p>Joseph would go on to develop a lot of skills in the water while working as a full time City of Long Beach Lifeguard for 6 years. He continues to serve the City of Long Beach as a part-time weekend lifeguard.  In the future, he's planning on shooting a lot more water based surf and fine art photography.</p>

                                  <p>Currently, Joseph creates high quality images using Nikon and Aquatech Imaging Solutions equipment. He's best known for photos of the Long Beach Boardwalk and Long Island surf-Lineups.  He has been published in online galleries by the leading surf media outlets such as Surfing Magazine, Eastern Surf Magazine, Whalebone, Surfline, and Magic Seaweed.</p>
