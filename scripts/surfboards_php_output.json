Often surfing together, Hobie promised to make Chuck a board when they got back to California. The board eventually got borrowed and subsequently lost and later was purchased by Metz in Sacramento around 1982.

It was glassed by Bosco Burns.\nHoled up in a Quonset hut at Makaha with a handful of mainlanders, Buzzy became immersed in the Hawaiian lifestyle. In his spare time, he dove, read and rode the biggest waves he could find. Makaha was his ultimate arena, not the bouncy shorebreak photo gallery, but 20-foot point surf. He scoffed at spinners and head-dips, preferring to sit farthest out on the gnarliest days and wait for the entire horizon to rise and greet him. Intent on iron-legging though the heaviest sections imaginable, a Makaha lip once snapped his leg like a toothpick. Trent rode the first of Bob Simmons",

Carroll's boycott of the South African events established him as a freethinking leader, and this inspired other pros to join his cause. By the late '80s, while fighting to reclaim his lost title, Carroll became the acknowledged master in Hawaii. His ascendancy at Pipeline, from finalist in his first attempt in 1979 to the first three-time Pipe Masters champion, bridged the gap between Gerry Lopez and Kelly Slater. His first win, in 1987, was driven by pure emotion the day after his sister died in an auto accident. In 1988, when he appeared set to reclaim his crown, Carroll earned surfing's first million-dollar contract with longtime backer Quiksilver. In 1991, in perfect 8- to 12-foot surf, he executed the most committed late drop and the heaviest under-the-lip snap in history to stamp his supremacy on the wave. Carroll's performances were equally dominant at Sunset, Haleiwa, Rockpile and later along Hawaii's outer reefs. (excerpt from Surfline",
